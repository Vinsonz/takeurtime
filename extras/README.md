The bus timetables
==================

As you can see in core3.js in main directory, I was planning to convert the bus schedules in these PDF files into JSON format, coz I saw android users have difficulty opening up PDF files, plus they break the user experience consistency. But due to laziness and hours of 9gagging, I didn't do that.

So if you are Good Guy Greg, you can convert the schedules in these PDFs into JSON format and make them for easy consumption. This will also save the bandwidth during application update as well.

If you are also lazy guy, update these PDFs often, and update the directory in cache.php as well.
