TakeUrTime - HTML5 APU/APIIT Timetable
======================================

You can access the app itself at http://www.anonoz.com/tut

Or you can read about the story of its existence on [my portfolio](http://www.anonoz.com/portfolio/takeurtime-apu-apiit/).

##For App Developers

You probably don't need my HTML, CSS, and JS front-end codes at all. You just either have to use my API on anonoz.com or if you have better modification, feel free to fork the server-side code and improve on your own, but do share what you have up in the sleeves. 

You can install the PHP in your server and serve to your iOS/Android/BB/WP apps, whatever. But if you use my API, a trackback link to my [blog and portfolio site](http://www.anonoz.com) would be great.
